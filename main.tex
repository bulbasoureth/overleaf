\title{Instrument Use Life Prediction Through Neural Networks}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
One of the advantageous properties of robotic surgery is the ample stream of generated quantitative data, providing information on the system itself such as system states, arm joint positions, and instrument data. Access to this information opens up opportunity to iterate on the current designs and algorithms, further improving efficiency. An analysis of instrument data is performed to create a predictive model for instrument expiration and usage limits. Running current instrument data through a neural network will predict if that instrument will expire before reaching end of use life.
